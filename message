Improved single state disambiguation worker method.

StageII: in get_edgelist_from_hashes_file, pruning the edgelist
periodically is now optional.

We can load identity pair partitions from a precomputed file now,
or recompute.

New graph partitioning algorithm implemented for partitioning
the identity pairs graph: Partitioner.py

The parallelization process in StageII is now more efficient:
Child processes are initialized once, the big fixed data 
are loaded once per child, and then blocks of data are sent to 
each child process as they finish the previous block. Idle times
eliminated, more efficient memory management.

This is accomplished through a "distribute" method and a data
generator. Now, the child processes receive a "pipe" through
which they keep receiving successive data chunks.

VerdictAuthority upgraded: the case of no middle names treated
separately.

Bootstrap method has data filenames abstracted. Other upgrades.
The case of no middle name is also added to the results-processing.

validate-national: very short names dropped. Single process search
also enabled.

config.py: variables for filenames of S2 acceptance coordinates
derived from bootstrapping.
MySQL table name for linked_identities table.

init.py: tokenization process now accepts keyword arguments.
