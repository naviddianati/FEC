'''
This module contains methods used for the second stage of disambiguation.
in this stage, we use combined national hashes and the state-level results
to identify pairs of records that are candidates for comparison but haven't
already been clustered together (will be mostly cross-state pairs). Then,
We divide these records into approximately independent partitions each of
which can be independently analyzed by a child process. This analysis consists
of performing pairwise comparisons for each specified pair and deciding about
whether to merge their corresponding clusters.
In making this decision, cluster level statistics will be used. That is,
information regarding name/employer/occupation/etc. frequencies obtained
from stage1 clusters are used.
