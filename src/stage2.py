'''
This module contains methods used for the second stage of disambiguation.
in this stage, we use combined national hashes and the state-level results
to identify pairs of records that are candidates for comparison but haven't
already been clustered together (will be mostly cross-state pairs). Then,
We divide these records into approximately independent partitions each of
which can be independently analyzed by a child process. This analysis consists
of performing pairwise comparisons for each specified pair and deciding about
whether to merge their corresponding clusters.
In making this decision, cluster level statistics will be used. That is,
information regarding name/employer/occupation/etc. frequencies obtained
from stage1 clusters are used.

def __get_customized_verdict_OLD(verdict, detailed_comparison_result):
    '''
    @deprecated: used for v1 and v2. 
    Function that makes the final judgment on the relationship between two
    records. It receives the output of the L{Record.compare} method consisting
    of a (preliminary) verdict and the detailed comparison results which
    provide information about the comparison results for the various fields
    of the records. Implement this method to define how these preliminary
    comparison results are to be interpreted ultimately. The output of this
    function will be used to determine the relationship between a pair of
    stage1 identities when a pair of records one from each are compared.
    The output of this function will determine if the two identities are
    to be merged, to be kept as irreconcilably separate, or as inconclusively
    similar.

    As an exmple, the fullname frequencies can be used to compute a positive
    score if C{verdict == True}.
    @param verdict: the verdict issued by L{Record.compare}. It can be True,
    False, or a large negative number. In the latter case, we have an
    irreconcilable difference such as different middle names.
    @param detailed_comparison_result: the result of comparisons of the
    various fields of the records. See L{Record._compare_THOROUGH} for the
    details.

    @return: a simple numerical verdict:
        - B{-1}: strongly inconsistent, such as when middle names are different.
        - B{0}: records are similar, but we don't have a conclusive verdict
        either way. We don't know that they're clearly a match, or clearly
        not a match.
        - B{>0}: records are a match.
        - B{None}: records are't similar, just ignore them.
