NAME PARTS PERFECTLY SPLIT

-- Noticed that I actually have first/last names separately from the address extractor. They are already registered in the tables newyork_addresses and ohio_addresses. So I don't need to parse the combined names that came with the FEC database!
-- Note: the middle names aren't there. I did not extract them from the .fec files, but I could if I wanted to. For now, I'll only use first and last names for identificatoin.
-- Note: some first/last names are missing in the .fec extracted data.
-- zip codes are now truncated to five digits in tokenize.
-- editdist.so is compiled both for 32 and 64 bit linux. The correct version should be copied to working directory depending on the machine.
