EMPLOYER GRAPH CLUSTERING DONE

--The two files graph_analyze.py and graph_visualize.py are fully functional and the code is capable of generating good visualizations of the graph of interconnected employers and its components.
--This version can be used to generate acceptable visualizations.
--A few additional auxilliary fields added to the initial MySQL query in main.py so all relevant information is extracted and recorded in future runs.
