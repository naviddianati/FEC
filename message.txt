MIGRATION + BUG FIXES


In Record.py _compare_STRICT_ADDRESS(), I think I found a strange bug.
For some reason, up to now, I've been allowing matches if one record
doesn't have an address if the names match exactly. This is waaaaay too
lax and I've removed it.

I'm starting a migration analysis code base as well. So, for compare_strict,
we have two methods now: one matches based on exact address mathces, and
the other matches based on exact employer and occupation. The latter is
used for producing the migration matrix where there simply can't be a 
geographical match.

In Affiliations.py, we now have a new subclass class 
MigrationAnalyzerUndirected(AffiliationAnalyzerUndirected) for generating
the migration matrix similarly to the affiliation transiion matrix.

The set of matching modes are expanded:
matching_mode can be "strict_address" or "strict_affiliation" or "thorough".

main_general.py now has an additional method generateMigrationData()
