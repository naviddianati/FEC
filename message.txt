MULTIPLE ADDITIONS

IdentityManager() class implemented.
functions added to hashes module for loading hashes and
computing edgelists from hashes.
States can now be sorted based on number of records rather
than population. Improves allocation in multiprocessing.
This is computed from the database and then exported to
json file for future use.   
New function partition_integer() for better allocation of
states to processes.
Lots of code cleanup and improved docstrings.
Using context managers (with statement) for working with
files.
